# BytePay – Java Employee Payroll System 💼

**BytePay** is a terminal-based Employee Payroll System built using Java. This project demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as **abstraction**, **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism** through a practical payroll use case. It provides a clean and modular design for managing employee types and calculating their salaries dynamically.

## 📌 Project Overview

BytePay allows users to input and manage different types of employees—full-time and part-time—via a simple terminal interface. It utilizes an abstract base class for shared employee attributes and enforces specific salary calculation logic through method overriding in child classes.

- 🧑‍💼 Subclasses `FullTimeEmployee` and `PartTimeEmployee` with specific salary logic
- 🔁 Method overriding to demonstrate polymorphism
- 🔒 Encapsulation of data with getters/setters
- 🖥️ Terminal-based interaction using Java's `Scanner`
- 📂 Organized and readable file structure
